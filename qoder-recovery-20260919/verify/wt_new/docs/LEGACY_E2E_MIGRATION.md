# Legacy E2E migration map — the eight `/` Journey Mode specs

Arbiter's ruling (pass-8, §4): do **not** swap `journey-status` for some V8
testid and call the migration done — "that is just resurrecting a selector
corpse". Archive each legacy spec only after its *capability invariant* has been
shown to exist in the current suite, and record the mapping either way.

## Why all eight fail identically

`src/main.tsx`'s `App()` renders `V8Experience` for every route and only falls
back to `LegacyApp` when the path starts with `/legacy`. The old Journey Mode
surface still exists — it was deliberately moved behind that path ("a first-time
user never lands on the legacy surface, see PHASE 2"). Each of the eight starts
with `page.goto("/")` and asserts `data-testid="journey-status"`, which only the
legacy tree renders.

Probe (temporary, reverted): pointing `golden.spec.ts` at `/legacy` made
`journey-status` resolve immediately, with `data-source="backend"` already
satisfied; the next assertion then failed on `ACTIVE` vs the real
`PLANNED · backend truth`. So the entry path is one line, and the remaining gap
is a truth-value question, not a dead surface.

## The map

| legacy spec | capability invariant it actually guards | current equivalent | status | decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `golden.spec.ts` | journey state comes from backend truth, and a closure event triggers recovery that survives reload | `backend/tests/test_guardian_v4.py`, `test_impact_resolver.py`; frontend `qoder-ack-resolution.spec.ts` (ack vs resolution, self-seeded) | covered at API + rendered level | **Archive** once `/legacy` entry is recorded; keep the reload-persistence case by porting it onto the V8 Live surface |
| `live-autopilot-v5.spec.ts` | zero-touch autopilot: provider pulse → CP-SAT V2 → recovery → reload | `test_solver_v2_integration.py`, `test_solver_runtime_gate.py`, `test_agent_mission_runtime.py`; `qoder-live-structure.spec.ts` L1→L2→L3 state matrix | recovery chain covered server-side; the *zero-touch* UI trigger is not | **Port first**: needs a V8-level test that the autopilot fires without a user prompt |
| `predictive-real-city-v6.spec.ts` | predictive real-city twin prevents a weakness before it bites | `test_v13_3_real_city_intelligence.py`, `v13-5-fully-grounded.spec.ts` (fully grounded discovery, passing) | partially covered — detection yes, autonomous prevention no | **Port first** |
| `product-hardening.spec.ts:10` | TravelerTwin Control Tower renders persisted evidence and an explicit authority boundary | `test_gpt_agent_authority_v3.py`, `test_gpt_v5_mission_authority.py` | authority boundary covered server-side; the Control Tower UI is legacy-only | **Archive** the UI expectations, keep the authority assertions |
| `product-hardening.spec.ts:21` | Control Tower compiles and reloads a persisted natural-language mission | `test_agent_mission_runtime.py`, `test_gpt_v5_mission_authority.py` | covered at runtime level, not through a UI | **Archive** with a note that no current UI owns this surface |
| `product-hardening.spec.ts:46` | assisted acceptance is policy-driven; route/feed evidence survives reload | `qoder-ack-rendered.spec.ts`, `qoder-ack-resolution.spec.ts`, `test_qoder_live_replans_endpoint.py` | covered, and covered *in the current product surface* | **Archive** |
| `product-hardening.spec.ts:172` | autonomous mode executes an envelope-safe recovery through the Agent Gateway | `test_gpt_agent_authority_v3.py`, `test_agent_runtime_gate.py` | gateway + envelope safety covered server-side | **Port first** if the V8 shell is meant to expose autonomous mode; otherwise archive |
| `product-hardening.spec.ts:251` | Proactive Guardian launches the flagship recovery without a new chat prompt | `test_guardian_v4.py`, `test_guardian_model_evidence.py`, `test_v10_flagship_e2e.py` | covered | **Archive** |

## Rules applied

- An invariant is "covered" only when something in the **current** suite asserts
  it against the **current** surface or API — not when a similarly-named old test
  exists.
- Where the capability is real but only the legacy UI asserted it visually, the
  decision is *port first, then archive*, so retiring the file never deletes a
  behaviour check.
- The four current-product specs (`product-v8` ×2, `real-world-trip-operations-v9`,
  `v10-live-execution`) are **not** in this file's archive list. Per the same
  ruling they stay in the default suite and get rewritten against today's V8
  behaviour; work so far: locale pinned (they assert English copy while the app
  follows `navigator.language`), the retired `hub.title` heading replaced by
  `today-heading`, `AI` → `Copilot`, `read-only ready` → the current
  `exec.readOnlyReady` value `available offline`, the hard-coded four offer cards
  turned into a logged branch, and the AgentComposer testid replaced by the
  Copilot dock.
- Open defect found while doing this: those three v10 specs pass in 9 seconds in
  isolation and fail inside the serial full run, because the suite shares one
  backend and one SQLite journey and earlier specs reset or re-select it. That is
  a test-infrastructure defect and is deliberately not papered over by
  reordering.
