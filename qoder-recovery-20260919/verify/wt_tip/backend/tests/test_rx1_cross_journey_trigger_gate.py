"""Recovery gate RX-1 — a trigger event may never cross a journey boundary.

Mutant J-CROSS-JOURNEY-TRIGGER (Codex Extreme v2, track J) removed the journey
scope check in ``generate_replan``:

    if trigger_event is None or trigger_event.journey_id != journey.id
 -> if trigger_event is None

and the whole existing suite stayed green, so the guard had no real gate.  The
reason is a vacuous assertion: ``test_replan_trigger_event_must_belong_to_same_
journey`` posts a ``WEATHER`` event that carries no affected activity, and that
request already fails later with ``REPLAN_TARGET_UNRESOLVED`` — which is *also*
HTTP 422.  ``assert response.status_code == 422`` therefore passes whether or not
the scope guard exists: it cannot tell "the guard refused a foreign journey" from
"the replan could not resolve a target".

This gate closes that hole by (a) asserting the guard's own message, and (b)
proving the same event is accepted on its own journey, so the refusal is caused
by the journey boundary and nothing else.

Layer: API integration (real FastAPI routes + real persistence).
